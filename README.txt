2. The subfolder Code has four folders:
        1. The folder "Task1-Vectorization" contains python script part1.py for Task-1
        2. The folder "Task-2-Gradient Descent" contains python script part2-gd.py for Task-2 for Gradient Descent
        3. The folder "Task-2-Stochastic-Gradient-Descent" contains python script part2-sgd.py for Stochastic Gradient Descent
        4. The folder "Task3-L2-Regularization" contains python script part3.py for Task-4
        
2. The subfolder Pseudocode has four folders:
        1. The folder "Task1-Vectorization" contains python script part1.txt for Task-1
        2. The folder "Task-2-Gradient Descent" contains python script part2-GD.txt for Task-2 for Gradient Descent
        3. The folder "Task-2-Stochastic-Gradient-Descent" contains python script part2-SGD.txt for Stochastic Gradient Descent
        4. The folder "Task3-L2-Regularization" contains python script part3-L2Regularisation.txt for Task-4
        
3. The subfolder Output has 3 snapshots of output files containing Evaluation Metrics and one graph for the time-to-train VS size-of-file

4. The Report-Assignment3.docx contains the entire documentation of steps and methods followed to do this Assignment, with brief description.
